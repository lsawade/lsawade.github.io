                    <p>
                    For over 40 yr, the global centroid-moment tensor (GCMT) project has determined location and source parameters for globally recorded earthquakes larger than magnitude 5.0. The GCMT database remains a trusted staple for the geophysical community. Its point-source moment-tensor solutions are the result of inversions that model long-period observed seismic waveforms via normal-mode summation for a 1-D reference earth model, augmented by path corrections to capture 3-D variations in surface wave phase speeds, and to account for crustal structure. While this methodology remains essentially unchanged for the ongoing GCMT catalogue, source inversions based on waveform modelling in low-resolution 3-D earth models have revealed small but persistent biases in the standard modelling approach. Keeping pace with the increased capacity and demands of global tomography requires a revised catalogue of centroid-moment tensors (CMT), automatically and reproducibly computed using Green's functions from a state-of-the-art 3-D earth model. In this paper, we modify the current procedure for the full-waveform inversion of seismic traces for the six moment-tensor parameters, centroid latitude, longitude, depth and centroid time of global earthquakes. We take the GCMT solutions as a point of departure but update them to account for the effects of a heterogeneous earth, using the global 3-D wave speed model GLAD-M25. We generate synthetic seismograms from Green's functions computed by the spectral-element method in the 3-D model, select observed seismic data and remove their instrument response, process synthetic and observed data, select segments of observed and synthetic data based on similarity, and invert for new model parameters of the earthquake's centroid location, time and moment tensor. The events in our new, preliminary database containing 9382 global event solutions, called CMT3D for '3-D centroid-moment tensors', are on average 4 km shallower, about 1 s earlier, about 5 per cent larger in scalar moment, and more double-couple in nature than in the GCMT catalogue. We discuss in detail the geographical and statistical distributions of the updated solutions, and place them in the context of earlier work. We plan to disseminate our CMT3D solutions via the online ShakeMovie platform.

                        <h1> Coordinate transformation on an ellipsoid </h1>

                        <object data="../includes/geocentric_geographic.html" height=400px width=100%></object>

                        <p>This is something I have spend a little time that does
                        not get much attention. Coordinate transformations from geocentric
                        to geodetic coordinates with respect to some ellipsoid. Here, I am
                        showing the effect of ellipticity on the resulting normal compared
                        to a sphere. In the case of a sphere, the outward normal is always
                        pointing away the center of the sphere. In the case of an ellipsoid,
                        the normal can be computed by taking the gradient of Equation 14.4
                        in Dahlen and Tromp. The resulting normal is shown in the figure below in dashed.
