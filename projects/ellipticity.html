This is something I have spend a little time that does
not get much attention. Coordinate transformations from geocentric
to geodetic coordinates with respect to some ellipsoid. Here, I am
showing the effect of ellipticity on the resulting normal compared
to a sphere. In the case of a sphere, the outward normal is always
pointing away the center of the sphere. In the case of an ellipsoid,
the normal can be computed by taking the gradient of Equation 14.4
in Dahlen and Tromp. The resulting normal is shown in the figure below in dashed.
