<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>
For over 40 yr, the global centroid-moment tensor (GCMT) project has determined
location and source parameters for globally recorded earthquakes larger than
magnitude 5.0. The GCMT database remains a trusted staple for the geophysical
community. Its point-source moment-tensor solutions are the result of inversions
that model long-period observed seismic waveforms via normal-mode summation for
a 1-D reference earth model, augmented by path corrections to capture 3-D
variations in surface wave phase speeds, and to account for crustal structure.
While this methodology remains essentially unchanged for the ongoing GCMT
catalogue, source inversions based on waveform modelling in low-resolution 3-D
earth models have revealed small but persistent biases in the standard modelling
approach. Keeping pace with the increased capacity and demands of global
tomography requires a revised catalogue of centroid-moment tensors (CMT),
automatically and reproducibly computed using Green's functions from a
state-of-the-art 3-D earth model. In this paper, we modify the current procedure
for the full-waveform inversion of seismic traces for the six moment-tensor
parameters, centroid latitude, longitude, depth and centroid time of global
earthquakes. We take the GCMT solutions as a point of departure but update them
to account for the effects of a heterogeneous earth, using the global 3-D wave
speed model GLAD-M25. We generate synthetic seismograms from Green's functions
computed by the spectral-element method in the 3-D model, select observed
seismic data and remove their instrument response, process synthetic and
observed data, select segments of observed and synthetic data based on
similarity, and invert for new model parameters of the earthquake's centroid
location, time and moment tensor. The events in our new, preliminary database
containing 9382 global event solutions, called CMT3D for '3-D centroid-moment
tensors', are on average 4 km shallower, about 1 s earlier, about 5 per cent
larger in scalar moment, and more double-couple in nature than in the GCMT
catalogue. We discuss in detail the geographical and statistical distributions
of the updated solutions, and place them in the context of earlier work. We plan
to disseminate our CMT3D solutions via the online ShakeMovie platform.
