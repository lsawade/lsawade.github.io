# Hi 

You probably landed here either because I gave you a link, or because you 
googled me. In the latter case, 'Yay me!', someone googled me!

Currently, I'm spending my time pursuing a Ph.D at Princeton University in 
Geophysics. My guide on this journey is mainly Jeroen Tromp with the occasional 
advice from Frederik J. Simons. My main focus in research lies on 
full-wavefrom Centroid Moment Tensor (CMT) inversion at global scale. Secondary
focuses are on numerical modeling in general, high performance computing, and
actually anything remotely related to seismology.

This page has started because I also want to promote reproducibility of 
research. Meaning, all my codes are published and accessible by anyone of
interest. Sharing is caring! You can find them in the research section of the 
page.
