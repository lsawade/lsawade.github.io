### Global CMT Inversion

The Global CMT inversion package that I am constantly working on is
can be found here: [GCMT3D](https://lsawade.github.io/GCMT3D/).


### How to make a Python package

A side project that I have been constantly expanding is the 
tutorial package [HTMAPP](https://lsawade.github.io/how_to_make_a_python_package/),
which in the beginngin I just wanted to have as a sample package.
It's so much more now. It's an almost complete overview on package 
management/distribution and a lot of small things that are not
covered in your Python tutorial.
It's basically a skeleton with every bone you need, but missing the
it's vital parts (the code that actually does stuff).


### Matlab functions etc.

Although I have put a substantial amount of time into Matlab coding, I have 
never documented all the code that have written. This has now changed,
and I will put Matlab codes that appear over time into this Github 
repository: [LWSS](https://github.com/lsawade/lwss).


### Receiver Functions

Receiver Function stuff shall go here... at some point...
