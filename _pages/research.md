### Global CMT Inversion

The Global CMT inversion package that I am constantly working on is

### How to make a Python package

A side project that I have been constantly expanding is the 
tutorial package [HTMAPP](https://lsawade.github.io/how_to_make_a_python_package/),
which in the beginngin I just wanted to have as a sample package.
It's so much more now. It's an almost complete overview on package
